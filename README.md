In order to start using and developing on this project, you need to install Pipenv.

```pip install --user pipenv```

Once you've done that, just run pipenv install in the project directory.

Then run pipenv shell in whatever terminal you'll be using to develope with.

I would recommend installing the Visual Studio Code along with the Python extension.

Add pipenv to your system path (Google it if you don't know how. Other people can explain it better than I can.).

Then VSCode should automagically handle the pipenv stuff for you mostly. So you won't have to run pipenv shell whenever you open a new terminal in VSCode.
